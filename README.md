Heads or Tails – Python Random Coin Toss

This is a beginner-friendly Python program that simulates a coin toss using Python’s built-in random module. Each run of the program randomly outputs Heads or Tails.

🎯 Purpose

The goal of this program is to demonstrate how to:

Generate random numbers in Python

Use conditional statements to control program output

Simulate real-life randomness (coin flipping)

🧠 How It Works

The program imports Python’s random module.

It generates a random integer:

0 represents Heads

1 represents Tails

An if-else statement checks the result and prints the outcome
